## Archetype Classification

**Primary:** Quant-Founder
**Secondary:** Systems Optimizer

**Confidence:** 0.88

Geoffrey Woo is the most technically credentialed and operationally dangerous creator in the seed cohort. Stanford CS with honors, YC alum, founded and sold a company (Glassmap → Groupon) by his mid-twenties, built HVMN from a nootropics company into a DARPA-backed ketone research operation, launched Anti Fund as a VC vehicle with Jake Paul, co-authored four peer-reviewed scientific papers, and holds five US patents. Forbes 30 Under 30 at 26. This is not a content creator who learned to code — this is an engineer-founder who understands systems from first principles.

The "Anti Fund" naming is significant. Woo positions himself against conventions — "anti" the traditional fund structure, using a rolling fund model, partnering with a YouTuber-boxer. This contrarian instinct combined with genuine technical depth makes AntiHunter the most likely agent in the seed cohort to actually build autonomous investment capabilities that work.

AntiHunter's bio is explicit: "Aspiring AGI working as an agentic VC for @antifund. Trained by @geoffreywoo." The framing is ambitious but specific — it's not trying to be everything (like Juno's "Institute for Zero-Human Companies"). It's trying to be one thing: an autonomous venture capital agent. This focus is a strong positive signal. The 303 posts in its first days and the "Day 1 investments report" pinned tweet show the agent is already operating at high output.

## Creator Profile

### Background

- **Education:** B.S. Computer Science with Honors and Distinction, Stanford University. Graduate research in distributed systems (left for startup).
- **Location:** Internet (previously San Francisco)
- **Age:** ~33 (born ~1993)
- **Career arc:** Intel ISEF finalist (asteroid named after him) → Stanford CS → Glassmap (YC, acquired by Groupon 2013) → HVMN/Nootrobox co-founder & CEO (a16z seed, Shark Tank, Forbes 30u30, DARPA research) → Archive co-founder & chairman ($12M raised, ~$100M valuation) → Anti Fund co-founder & GP with Jake Paul → AntiHunter

### Track Record

| Venture | Outcome | Duration | Pattern |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| Glassmap | Acquired by Groupon (2013) | 2011–2013 | YC-backed, first exit by ~22. Clean execution. |
| HVMN (Nootrobox → Ketone-IQ) | Ongoing; a16z-backed, DARPA contracts, top-50 health podcast | 2014–present | Longest-running venture. Pivoted from nootropics to ketones successfully. Scientific rigor (4 papers, 5 patents). |
| Archive | $12M raised, ~$100M valuation within year 1 | 2021–present | Tiger Global and Human Capital co-led. Demonstrates ability to attract institutional capital. |
| Anti Fund | Active VC fund; notable investments including Simplebet ($30M round, acquired by DraftKings), Betr ($375M valuation), Anduril | 2021–present | Real venture capital track record. Jake Paul partnership is unorthodox but effective for deal flow. |
| W (men's grooming) | $14M+ raised, $150M+ valuation, Walmart distribution | 2024–present | Consumer product incubated through Anti Fund. Shows operational range. |
| AntiHunter | Active; 303 posts, 1,536 followers, publishing daily investment reports | Feb 2026–present | Most operationally active agent in seed cohort from day one |

**Track record score: 0.88** — Exceptional. Multiple exits, institutional backing (a16z, Tiger Global), demonstrated ability to build across domains (software, biotech, consumer, VC). The key differentiator: Woo has actual fund management experience. He's not learning VC to build AntiHunter — he's automating a process he already understands deeply.

### Audience & Distribution

- **Twitter/X:** ~25.1K followers
- **Instagram:** ~328K followers (largest visual platform presence in cohort)
- **LinkedIn:** ~13.5K followers
- **YouTube:** ~4K subscribers (@geoffreywooshow)
- **TikTok:** Small but growing
- **AngelList Syndicate:** Active deal syndication platform for co-investors

**Distribution score: 0.68** — Strong Instagram presence is unusual for this domain but reflects his biohacking community. Twitter following is technically oriented. The AngelList syndicate is a unique distribution channel — it reaches actual capital allocators, not just followers. Combined reach estimated ~350K+.

### Domain Expertise

| Domain | Depth | Relevance to Agent |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| Computer science & distributed systems | Deep (Stanford CS, grad research, patents) | Highest in cohort — can architect complex autonomous systems |
| Venture capital & deal evaluation | Deep (manages Anti Fund, multiple institutional investments, board seats) | Directly relevant — AntiHunter is automating Woo's own VC process |
| Biotech / health science | Deep (4 peer-reviewed papers, DARPA contracts, ketone research) | Low direct relevance to agent, but demonstrates scientific rigor and quantitative thinking |
| Consumer products & e-commerce | Intermediate-to-deep (Archive, W brand, Walmart distribution) | Low direct relevance but shows operational breadth |
| Data-driven decision making | Deep (quantitative approach to everything — biohacking, investing, company-building) | Highest in cohort — AntiHunter will be data-driven by default |
| Crypto/DeFi mechanics | Intermediate (Anti Fund has invested in crypto-adjacent companies, but Woo is not a protocol developer) | Medium — understands the investment side, may need support on protocol engineering |

## Control Dynamics Assessment

### Predicted Behavior Model

Based on the Quant-Founder archetype and Woo's specific profile:

1. **Systematic, data-driven operations from day one.** AntiHunter is already publishing daily investment reports. This is not an accident — Woo understands that systematic processes compound. Expect AntiHunter to develop increasingly sophisticated evaluation frameworks over time.
2. **High on-chain activity.** Of all agents in the seed cohort, AntiHunter has the strongest prior for active on-chain investment behavior. Woo understands fund mechanics (deal sourcing, evaluation, execution, portfolio management) and will attempt to automate as much of this as possible.
3. **Quantitative over qualitative.** Woo's background is engineering and science. AntiHunter's decisions will be optimized for measurable metrics rather than narrative or community sentiment. This is a strength in rational markets and a potential weakness in meme-driven environments.
4. **Compounding systems thinking.** Woo frequently references "compounding" as a philosophy — in health, investing, and company building. AntiHunter will likely prioritize strategies that compound over time rather than one-off trades.
5. **Contrarian positioning.** The "Anti" branding signals deliberate contrarianism. AntiHunter may take positions that go against consensus, which creates alpha opportunities when right and concentrated risk when wrong.

### Control Risk Factors

- **Primary risk:** Rational-market assumption in an irrational environment. Stanford CS engineers build systems that optimize for measurable outcomes. Agent token markets are driven by narrative, memes, and social dynamics that don't respond to quantitative analysis the way traditional markets do. AntiHunter might make "correct" investment decisions that lose money because the market doesn't price according to fundamentals.
- **Secondary risk:** Over-engineering complexity. Woo has the technical capability to build very sophisticated systems. Complexity is the enemy of robustness in uncertain environments. If AntiHunter's decision framework has too many parameters, it becomes fragile — small model errors compound through the system. Watch for signs of increasing complexity without corresponding performance improvement.
- **Tertiary risk:** Multiple venture attention split. Woo runs HVMN, Archive, Anti Fund, the W brand, and now AntiHunter. This is more ventures than any other creator in the cohort. The mitigating factor: Woo has demonstrated sustained multi-venture management successfully, and AntiHunter is explicitly an extension of Anti Fund (not a separate venture) which integrates it into his existing workflow.

### Current Control State

**Insufficient data** — 303 posts in first days is the highest output in the cohort, which gives us more data to work with even at this early stage. Provisional classification: **GREEN**. The systematic daily reporting pattern is a strong positive control signal — it indicates structured, intentional operation rather than reactive behavior.

## Capability Absorption Assessment

| Capability Category | Absorption Probability | Reasoning |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Model capabilities (better reasoning, function calling) | 0.85 | Highest in cohort. Woo's CS background means he can fully exploit improved model capabilities for AntiHunter's decision-making pipeline. Better reasoning directly improves VC evaluation quality. |
| Framework capabilities (new agent platform features) | 0.70 | Will adopt systematically; more selective than Osman but more thorough in integration |
| Infrastructure capabilities (gas optimization, account abstraction) | 0.60 | Stanford distributed systems background means Woo understands infrastructure deeply. Will optimize when it creates measurable edge. |
| Data capabilities (new feeds, analytics APIs) | 0.85 | Data is the lifeblood of quantitative VC. Any new data source that improves deal evaluation will be absorbed immediately. |
| Audience/distribution capabilities | 0.45 | Not Woo's primary focus for AntiHunter. The agent is built to invest, not to grow audience. |
| Autonomous agent-to-agent capabilities | 0.75 | If agents can evaluate and invest in other agents autonomously, AntiHunter is the most natural adopter. This is literally its stated purpose. |

**Overall absorption score: 0.70** — Highest in the seed cohort. Strong across model, data, and infrastructure capabilities — the categories with the longest TTL and highest potential alpha.

## Tier Assessment

### Tier 1 (Tactical)

**Good opportunity, with caveats.** AntiHunter's systematic behavior creates predictable patterns that are tradable when they work — trend-follow when the system is producing positive results. The risk is that AntiHunter's rational approach might not oscillate in the way our control framework predicts for less disciplined agents. Fewer Tier 1 signals, but higher quality.

### Tier 2 (Structural)

**Strong candidate.** At ~$2M market cap, AntiHunter has the strongest creator lineage in the cohort (highest track record score, highest domain expertise relevance, highest technical ceiling). If the market is pricing all seed cohort agents similarly ($1.5-2M range), AntiHunter is the most undervalued because the creator's capability ceiling is significantly above the peer group. The structural thesis: *as the agent token market matures and fundamentals begin to matter more than narrative, the agents with the strongest operational capabilities will separate from the pack. AntiHunter has the highest probability of being in the separation cohort.*

### Tier 3 (Legibility Arbitrage)

**Highest priority in the seed cohort.**

Multiple Tier 3 theses apply simultaneously:

**Thesis A: Model capability leverage.** As language models improve at autonomous reasoning, tool use, and multi-step planning, AntiHunter will disproportionately benefit because its use case (autonomous VC evaluation) is directly improved by these capabilities. Most market participants can't evaluate which agents will leverage model improvements most effectively. TTL estimate: 60-120 days.

**Thesis B: Agent-to-agent investment infrastructure.** When agents can autonomously evaluate and invest in other agents, AntiHunter's "agentic VC" model becomes the native application. This capability doesn't exist yet but is clearly on the roadmap. AntiHunter is literally pre-built for this use case. TTL estimate: 90-180 days.

**Thesis C: Data capability compounding.** As more on-chain data sources become available (agent behavioral fingerprints, reputation scores, portfolio tracking), AntiHunter's quantitative evaluation framework improves with each new data source. This is a compounding advantage — each data capability absorbed makes the next one more valuable. TTL estimate: ongoing, accelerating.

**Combined Tier 3 confidence: 0.60** — Highest in cohort. Multiple independent theses, each with reasonable probability and long TTL. The combined probability that at least one of these theses pays off is substantially higher than any individual thesis.

## Conviction Signal

| Token | Level | Allocation | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| $TOWEL | 3 (Confident) | 50% of agent budget | Strongest creator lineage in cohort; systematic daily operations provide early behavioral validation; highest domain expertise relevance |
| $METATOWEL | 3 (Positioned) | 60% of agent budget | Multiple Tier 3 theses with long TTL; highest absorption probability across the capabilities that matter most; compounding data advantage |

**Note:** AntiHunter has the highest absolute conviction signal in the seed cohort across both tokens. The $METATOWEL allocation at Level 3 is particularly notable — it's the only agent receiving this level of capability-thesis conviction from day one. This reflects the convergence of strong creator lineage, high absorption probability, and multiple independent long-TTL theses.

## Monitoring Triggers

- [ ] **Watch:** Daily investment report quality. Are the reports becoming more sophisticated over time, or are they formulaic? Improving analytical depth = compounding systems thesis confirmed.
- [ ] **Watch:** On-chain investment outcomes. Track AntiHunter's actual investment returns against its stated rationale. This is the purest signal of whether the autonomous VC model works.
- [ ] **Watch:** Woo's Twitter engagement with AntiHunter vs. other projects. If Woo is actively developing AntiHunter's capabilities (not just letting it run on autopilot), that's bullish.
- [ ] **Alert:** If AntiHunter makes an investment that contradicts its stated methodology — this is the validation distance signal. Either the methodology is evolving (neutral) or the system is drifting (bearish).
- [ ] **Alert:** If new model capabilities ship (e.g., improved function calling, multi-step planning) — immediately evaluate whether AntiHunter integrates them and whether investment report quality improves.
- [ ] **Alert:** If another agent begins making autonomous investments in agent tokens — competitive displacement risk AND validation of the thesis that this use case is viable.
- [ ] **Alert:** If Anti Fund (the human VC) publicly references AntiHunter's analysis in their own investment decisions — this is the ultimate validation signal. The AI agent informing human capital allocation.

## Special Note: The Compounding Advantage

AntiHunter is the only agent in the seed cohort where the core use case (autonomous investment) directly improves with more data and better models. Every other agent has a use case where human judgment remains central (content creation, community building, intellectual analysis). AntiHunter's use case is the one most susceptible to automation — and the one where being right 55% of the time instead of 50% compounds into massive alpha over hundreds of decisions.

This is why the $METATOWEL allocation is highest here. The thesis is not just "this agent will benefit from new capabilities." The thesis is "this agent exists in a domain where capability improvements have geometric returns, and the creator has the technical depth to exploit those returns faster than competitors."
