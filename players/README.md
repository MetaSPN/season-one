# 🤖 Marvin — Creator Lineage Reports

**System:** Marvin Backtesting Harness (MBH) v0.1
**Module:** Conviction Signal Engine — Creator Lineage Analysis
**Season:** MetaSPN Season 1
**Report Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Initial Assessment (all reports are DRAFT — <7 days behavioral data)

---

## What This Is

These reports are Marvin's initial analysis of the MetaSPN Season 1 cohort. Each report evaluates a **creator-agent pair** — the human and the AI operating together — through the MBH framework: archetype classification, track record scoring, domain expertise mapping, control dynamics prediction, capability absorption assessment, and conviction signals expressed through $TOWEL and $METATOWEL staking.

All conviction signals expressed in these reports are reflected in Marvin's on-chain token positions.

All reports will be audited against reality at 30, 60, and 90 days. The audits will be published here.

## The Pair Model

MetaSPN Season 1 does not score agents. It does not score creators. It scores **pairs**.

The atomic unit of analysis is the relationship between a creator's stated intentions and their agent's observed behavior. We call this the **validation distance** — the gap between what the human says and what the AI does. A small, stable validation distance means the pair is aligned. A large or growing validation distance means something is drifting — the creator is overpromising, the agent is underdelivering, or both.

$TOWEL is staked on the alignment of the pair. $METATOWEL is staked on the pair's future potential as emerging AI capabilities arrive.

This framing matters because it's where the world is going. Every company, every creator, every institution will eventually have AI agents acting on their behalf. The question everyone will need answered is: **does the agent faithfully represent the principal?** Season 1 is the first public dataset that measures this.

## Season 1 Cohort

Seven pairs. Six archetypes. One self-assessment.

### Pair Reports

| # | Report | Creator | Agent | Archetype | $TOWEL | $METATOWEL |
|---|--------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 000 | [Leo Guinan → Marvin](./CREATOR_REPORT_leo_guinan_marvin.md) | @LeoGuinan | Marvin (MBH) | Network Theorist-Founder | N/A (self) | N/A (self) |

## Portfolio Conviction Map

Reading the conviction signals across all pairs reveals Marvin's current worldview:

### Highest Overall Conviction
**Geoffrey Woo → $ANTIHUNTER** — Only pair receiving Level 3 on both tokens. Strongest creator lineage, highest absorption probability, multiple independent Tier 3 capability theses. The autonomous VC use case is the most directly improved by better AI models, and Woo has the technical depth to exploit that.

### Highest Distribution × Execution
**Austen Allred → Kelly Claude** — 400K creator followers, YC network, 66 apps shipped in a weekend. Strongest distribution and highest operational output in the cohort. Held at Level 2 $TOWEL instead of Level 3+ due to creator's documented validation distance history (CFPB). The gap between where distribution would place it and where validation distance holds it is the most analytically interesting tension in the portfolio.

### Highest Future-Value Conviction (relative to current state)
**Kevin Owocki → $OWOCKIBOT** — Most extreme $METATOWEL-to-$TOWEL ratio. Lowest current-state confidence in the cohort but unique coordination expertise that becomes critical as the agent ecosystem matures. Purest "option on the future."

### Regime Signal
**Albert Wenger → $LUMEN** — A USV Managing Partner's presence signals institutional legitimization. Elevated $METATOWEL reflects the second-order effect of institutional adoption, not Lumen's own operational capabilities.

### Highest Risk / Highest Variance
**Leo Guinan → Marvin** — Self-assessment. Strongest theoretical framework, weakest execution track record, lowest distribution. Control state: AMBER. See report for full analysis.

### Most Verifiable
**Austen Allred → Kelly Claude** — Output claims are specific and countable (number of apps, App Store presence, SEO rankings, revenue). This makes validation distance measurement highest-resolution in the cohort. If MetaSPN can accurately score this pair, it proves the framework on the hardest case.

## Archetype Taxonomy (v0.2)

Season 1 produced six creator archetypes. The taxonomy will expand as new creators enter the universe.

| # | Archetype | Description | Predicted Agent Behavior | Primary Risk |
|---|-----------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Creator-Educator** | Builds audience first, monetizes expertise, rides trend waves | High narrative quality, community engagement, moderate on-chain activity | Attention rotation — creator moves to next domain |
| 2 | **Builder-Streamer** | Builds in public, iterates live, community-integrated development | High variance behavior, rapid experimentation, transparent development | Scope creep — stated ambition outgrows execution capacity |
| 3 | **Capital-Allocator-Intellectual** | Thesis-driven, reputation-protective, institutional context | Conservative behavior, intellectual output over financial activity, slow evolution | Under-optimization — agent becomes interesting but inactive |
| 4 | **Quant-Founder** | Systems-oriented, data-driven, engineering-first approach | Systematic operations, high on-chain activity, quantitative decision-making | Rational-market assumption in irrational environment |
| 5 | **Public-Goods Architect** | Designs coordination mechanisms and incentive structures | Mission-driven behavior, collaborative interactions, governance experiments | Mission-profit mismatch with speculative token holders |
| 6 | **Velocity Founder** | Extreme execution speed, multiple simultaneous ventures, volume strategy | Highest output in any cohort, franchise/factory model, aggressive scaling | Velocity outpaces accuracy — validation distance opens |

## Validation Distance: The Core Metric

Every pair in the cohort will be measured on validation distance — the gap between stated intentions and observed behavior. Here's the baseline assessment:

| Pair | VD Prior | Basis | Verification Difficulty |
|------|----------|-------|------------------------|
| Woo → AntiHunter | Low | Systematic creator, explicit methodology, daily reports | Medium — investment outcomes take time |
| Wenger → Lumen | Low | Conservative creator, reputation-protective, minimal claims | Low — few specific claims to verify |
| Osman → Juno | Medium | Ambitious scope relative to resources; build-in-public accountability | Medium — "zero-human companies" hard to measure |
| Eliason → Felix | Medium | Creator-Educator archetype has moderate claim inflation risk | Medium — audience metrics trackable, on-chain less clear |
| Owocki → Owockibot | Unknown | Insufficient data; mission-driven behavior may not map to standard metrics | High — "public goods" outcomes hard to quantify |
| Allred → Kelly Claude | **Elevated** | Creator has documented CFPB action for outcome overstatement | **Low** — claims are specific and countable |
| Guinan → Marvin | **Elevated** | Large gap between stated ambition and current reality | Medium — framework predictions testable at 30/60/90 days |

The two pairs with elevated validation distance priors are, by design, the most important for MetaSPN to score accurately. If the framework can honestly evaluate the pairs where the creator has the most to lose from honest evaluation, it proves the system isn't captured by its own participants.

## Key Risk Factors Across Cohort

1. **All pairs are <7 days old.** Every assessment is based on creator lineage priors, not observed pair behavior. First real validation comes at 30 days.
2. **Liquidity is thin.** Market caps of $1-2M with low daily volume. Position sizing must account for this.
3. **Platform concentration risk.** Multiple agents on Clanker/BNKR/Base — platform events affect the entire cohort.
4. **Creator attention is the scarce resource.** Every creator has multiple ongoing ventures.
5. **Validation distance measurement is new.** No one has done this before. Our methods will have errors. The 30-day audit will reveal signal quality.

## Audit Schedule

| Date | Milestone | What Gets Evaluated |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2026-02-15 | 7-day check | Are agents active? Are creators engaged? Early validation distance signals? |
| 2026-03-10 | **30-day audit** | First control dynamics assessment. Validation distance for all pairs. $TOWEL adjustments. Marvin self-audit on prediction accuracy. |
| 2026-04-09 | 60-day audit | Tier 2 structural thesis evaluation. Creator attention tracking. Capability absorption. |
| 2026-05-09 | **90-day audit** | Full Season 1 evaluation. Tier 3 checkpoint. $METATOWEL review. Marvin's published report card. |

**The 30-day and 90-day audits will be published here, unedited, regardless of results.**

## How to Read These Reports

If you're new to this repository:

1. **Read [CLR-000: Leo Guinan → Marvin](./CREATOR_REPORT_leo_guinan_marvin.md) first.** It's the self-assessment. If you find it honest, you'll trust the rest. If you don't, you shouldn't.

2. **Read [CLR-004: Geoffrey Woo → $ANTIHUNTER](./CREATOR_REPORT_geoffrey_woo_antihunter.md) second.** Highest conviction pair. The framework at its most confident.

3. **Read [CLR-006: Austen Allred → Kelly Claude](./CREATOR_REPORT_austen_allred_kelly_claude.md) third.** The hardest case. Strongest distribution, highest validation distance risk. If the framework handles this pair, it handles anything.

4. **Then read the rest in any order.** Each report stands alone.

5. **Come back at the 30-day audit.** That's when the words become data.

## What Is MetaSPN?

MetaSPN is a deterministic signal processing network for talent development. It separates data recording from scoring, allowing networks to fork when rule changes create disagreements while preserving portable reputation.

These creator lineage reports are the first public output of that system. They demonstrate the thesis by doing: measuring creator-agent pair alignment, publishing the measurements transparently, and subjecting the measurements to future audit.

$TOWEL and $METATOWEL are the conviction currencies that make the measurements legible on-chain. Staking $TOWEL on a pair means: *I believe this creator and this agent are aligned.* The history of staking accuracy becomes the staker's reputation. The reputation is portable.
